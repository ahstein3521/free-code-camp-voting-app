#####Note for the FCC instructors:
A great portion of this code comes directly from Stephen Grider's redux course on Udemy:

The last thing I would want to do is take credit for the work of this excellent instructor, 
especially when his tutorials helped me establish a solid foundation for creating full scale apps with the MERN
stack as well as taken my grasp of programming to a new level!
To be clear- this code is my own, but I feel as though the completion this project is in thanks to his course and I used many of his examples as a basis for solving these user stories.
